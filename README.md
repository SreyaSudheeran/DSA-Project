File Compression Algorithms:

    Huffman Coding: Efficient file compression and decompression using the Huffman Coding technique.
    LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) Compression: Implementation of the LZW technique for file compression and decompression.

Getting Started
Installation

    Clone the DSA repository:

bash

git clone https://github.com/SreyaSudheeran/DSA

    Change to the project directory:

bash

cd DSA

Compilation

    Huffman Coding:

    bash

gcc -o huffman huffman.c

LZW Compression:

bash

    gcc -o lzw lzw.c

Usage
Huffman Coding

To compress or decompress a file using Huffman coding, use the following commands in the terminal:

    Compression:

    bash

./huffman c input_file output_file

Decompression:

bash

    ./huffman d input_file output_file

LZW Compression

For compressing or decompressing files using the LZW technique, use the following commands:

    Compression:

    bash

./lzw c input_file output_file

Decompression:

bash

    ./lzw d input_file output_file
